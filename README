A jQuery port of the Low Pro behavior framework that was originally written for Prototype.



In brief
--------

Create a behavior as a class:

Testy = $.klass({
 initialize: function(arg) {
   alert('ive just been attached with the arg ' + arg);
 },
 onclick: function() {
   alert('ive been clicked');
 }
});

Btw, $.klass is a full port of Prototype's Class.create so youget that as a bonus and 
can use all the inheritance stuff in the same way.

Next, attach the behavior on DOM ready in the jQuery way:

jQuery(function($) {
 $('p').attach(Testy, 'My arg');
});

Alternatively, if you just need to attach behaviors and get references to the behavior instances
created then you can use:

$('a').attachAndReturn(Clicky, 45) //=> Array of behavior instances

Aside from this everything works the same as Low Pro for Prototype.
See http://www.danwebb.net/lowpro for details.



Livequery support
-----------------

If the livequery plugin is found then Low Pro will use it to automatically bind behaviors to
newly created content so if, taking the above example, you did something like:

$(document.body).append('<p>A new para</p>')

Then it too would get a behavior binded to it.



Acknowledgements
----------------

The $.klass code is a direct port of the Class.create code from Prototype (http://prototypejs.org).
